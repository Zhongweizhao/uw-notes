\topic{Some Paradoxes}
There are lots of paradoxes in English, such as "This statement is false". 

There are also some paradoxes in Mathematical world.




\topic{Russell's Paradox} 
Let $X$ be the set of all sets. Let $S=\{A\in X| A\notin A\}$. Is $S \in S$?

\topic{Some Question}
To avoid such paradoxes, some question was raised.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is an allowable mathematical object?
	\item What is an allowable mathematical statement?
    \item What is an allowable mathematical proof?
\end{enumerate}

\topic{Mathematical Object}
Essentially all mathematical objects are (mathematical) sets. In math, a set is a certain specific kind of collection whose elements are sets. Not all collection of sets are called sets. For a collection to be a set, it must be constructable using specific rules. These rules are called the ZFC axioms of set theory (or the Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel axioms along with the Axiom of Choice)

These axioms include (imply) the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empty Set: there exist a set, denoted by $\emptyset$, with no elements.
    \item Equality: two sets are equal when they have the same elements. $A = B$ when for every set $x$, $x\in A \iff x\in B$
    \item Pair Axiom: if $A$ and $B$ are sets then so is $\{A,B\}$
    \item Union Axiom: if $S$ is a set of sets then $\cup_{S} = \{x|x\in A$ for some $A\in S\} $. If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then so is $\{A,B\}$ hence so is $A\cup B = \cup_{\{A,B\}}$
    
\end{itemize}
